<p>
Sudden cardiac death is by definition fatal and it is by definition fast. Some definitions say it is <i>sudden</i> if death occurs less than one hour after the onset of symptoms. Other definitions say it is <i>sudden</i> if death occurs less than one hour after loss of consciousness, even if symptoms were present for several hours. Most sources (but not all) agree that a death qualifies as sudden cardiac death even if you know the cause. This website will take the more common view that sudden cardiac death includes all fatalities whether or not the precise mechanism is known.
</p>

<p>
Myocardial infarction (misleadingly called <a href="heart_terminology.html">heart attack</a>) is a very common cause of sudden cardiac death, but it is not the only cause. Cardiac <a href="heart_terminology.html">arrhythmias</a> can also cause sudden cardiac death in the absence of a myocardial infarction.

<h2>Many Drugs Cause Sudden Cardiac Death</h2>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Many drugs interfere with normal heart function and thus cause sudden cardiac death, either via myocardial infarction (heart attack) of via arrhythmia.
</p>

<p>
<a href="cocaine.html">Cocaine</a> is especially notorious for causing sudden cardiac death, see the linked page on cocaine.
</p>

<p>
<a href="classical_stimulants.html">Classical stimulants</a> are also associated with sudden cardiac death, but most of them (such as Adderall) are considerably safer than cocaine. In fact, a number of very large studies with no industry funding found that ADHD medications like Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Adderall (amphetamine) <b>do not</b> cause an increased risk of sudden cardiac death when taken at therapeutic doses.
