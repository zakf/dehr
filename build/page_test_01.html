<div class="indent">

<p>
This is the first paragraph of contents in the file page_test_01.html.
</p>

<p>
This is the second paragraph.

<h2>This Is a Heading:</h2>

<div class="indent">

<p>
The heading above should NOT be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags.
</p>

<p>
<b>This IS wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags</b> because the &lt;b&gt; was preceded by an escape character (backslash), but the escape character has been stripped.
</p>

<p>
I will name this paragraph Frank.

This line is <b><i>still</i></b> part of Frank because I escaped the double-newline, but the escape character has been removed from the output.
</p>

<p>
Frank is over, this is NOT Frank anymore. Here is a newline character:
The preceding newline character was included inside the paragraph because it was only one character, not two or more.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph was preceded by like 5 newlines, but only 2 will be visible in the output.
</p>

<p>
Simple paragraph. Look here: This test is working.
</p>

<p>
This is a normal paragraph.
</p>

<i>This</i> will <b>not</b> be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags because it started with an unescaped &lt;i&gt; tag.

<b>You</b> probably cannot tell that this is supposed to be a new paragraph, but it is not. It starts with an unescaped &lt;b&gt; tag.

<p>
This is another normal paragraph.
</p>

<p>
One more simple paragraph.
</p>

<p>
Here is the <tt>page_title</tt> Django template variable:
<br />
<b>This Is the Page Title</b>
<br />
That's awesome, see how it is possible to use Django template syntax directly inside this file?
</p>

<p>
Final paragraph, have a nice day.
</p>

<h2>Rigorous Testing of the Lexer and Parser</h2>

<div class="indent">

<p>
This should be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags and indented.
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
This should be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags and indented <b>even more.</b>
</p>

</div> <!-- div.indent -->

<p>
This should be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags and indented.
</p>

This line starts with &lt;nop&gt; and should NOT have P tags.

<b>You cannot</b> tell that this is a new paragraph in the source file, it lacks P tags. This sentence and the two prior sentences (three sentences total) all look like one paragraph in a browser.

<p>
<b>This</b> will appear as a new paragraph.
</p>

<p>
The phrase <nop> (NOP) inside a paragraph is NOT taken out by the parser, but it is a meaningless HTML tag so it is invisible in a web browser.
</p>

</div> <!-- div.indent -->

<h2>Testing the Custom Template Tags</h2>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<b>Simple Tag Examples:</b>
<br />
First example, only one argument: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=puffer fish&title=Special%3ASearch">puffer fish</a>.
<br />
Second example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=lederhosen&title=Special%3ASearch">this has two arguments</a>, the first is the target (the Wikipedia page title) and the second is the displayed text.
</p>

<p>
Here is a <!-- I need to OMIT the final newline or else it will be in the final HTML -->

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=lobster&amp;title=Special%3ASearch">link about lobsters</a> on Wikipedia. The prior link used the <tt>old_wiki</tt> tag.
</p>

<p>
Did you know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Pluto (mythology)&title=Special%3ASearch">Pluto</a> is a Greek god but is <i>not</i> a planet? I think that is a terrible dishonor. Also, this paragraph uses the newer <tt>wiki</tt> tag.
