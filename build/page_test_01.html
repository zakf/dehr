<h1>This Is the Page Title</h1>

<p>
This is the first paragraph of contents in the file page_test_01.html.
</p>

<p>
This is the second paragraph.
</p>

<h2>This Is a Heading:</h2>

<p>
The heading above should NOT be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags.
</p>

<p>
<b>This IS wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags</b> because the &lt;b&gt; was preceded by an escape character (backslash), but the escape character has been stripped.
</p>

<p>
I will name this paragraph Frank.

This line is <b><i>still</i></b> part of Frank because I escaped the double-newline, but the escape character has been removed from the output.
</p>

<p>
Frank is over, this is NOT Frank anymore. Here is a newline character:
The preceding newline character was included inside the paragraph because it was only one character, not two or more.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph was preceded by like 5 newlines, but only 2 will be visible in the output.
</p>

<p>
Simple paragraph.
</p>

<p>
This is a normal paragraph.
</p>

<i>This</i> will <b>not</b> be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags because it started with an unescaped &lt;i&gt; tag.

<b>You</b> probably cannot tell that this is supposed to be a new paragraph, but it is not. It starts with an unescaped &lt;b&gt; tag.

<p>
This is another normal paragraph.
</p>

<p>
One more simple paragraph.
</p>

<p>
Here is the <tt>page_title</tt> Django template variable:
<br />
<b>This Is the Page Title</b>
<br />
That's awesome, see how it is possible to use Django template syntax directly inside this file?
</p>

<p>
Final paragraph, have a nice day.
</p>
