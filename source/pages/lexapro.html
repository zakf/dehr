Lexapro (escitalopram) is a very good example of an SSRI antidepressant. SSRI stands for <i>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</i>. Lexapro works by binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) and inhibiting it. When SERT is inhibited, serotonin cannot move from the synapse back into the presynaptic cell, so the serotonin builds up in the synapse and continues stimulating serotonin receptors of all kinds.

Because Lexapro is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, it boosts the level of serotonin seen by all the serotonin receptor subtypes. In general, this causes anxiety relief and improved mood.

Increased serotonin can also cause nausea and vomiting, especially via the 5-HT(3) serotonin receptor.

Increased serotonin also stimulates the 5-HT(2C) receptor, and this paradoxically tends to cause anxiety and depression. After one to four weeks of treatment with SSRI antidepressants like Lexapro, the number of 5-HT(2C) receptors in your brain goes down dramatically and these side effects may disappear.
