<h2>Heart Attack</h2>

{% indent %}

Heart attack is a misleading term and it should be avoided on this website. Well-educated English speakers often consider the phrase <i>heart attack</i> to be synonymous with <i>myocardial infarction</i>, but this is misleading because it specifically excludes other kinds of {% link 'sudden cardiac death' %}. Many English speakers would use the phrase <i>heart attack</i> to describe any sudden and fatal heart problem, but this is generally considered incorrect.

<h2>Myocardial Infarction (MI)</h2>

{% indent %}

A {% wiki 'myocardial infarction' %} is when a portion of the heart muscle dies, usually from lack of oxygen, usually from a blocked coronary artery. The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle, and they get clogged with fatty plaques as people age. Blood clots can also cause a blockage (embolism) leading to a myocardial infarction.

Just before death, a myocardial infarction usually causes a cardiac arrhythmia. This is either because a large portion of the heart muscle is dead, or it is because the blood pressure is too low to supply blood to the heart itself.

<h2>Cardiac Arrhythmia</h2>

{% indent %}

A {% wiki 'cardiac arrhythmia' %} is when the heart beats in an abnormal and bad way. The heart may be beating too fast (tachycardia) or too slow (bradycardia), and it may or may not be pumping blood effectively. The heart may be quivering without pumping at all (e.g. ventricular fibrillation). Even if the heart is still pumping effectively, one cardiac arrhythmia can often evolve into another more serious arrhythmia that will not supply the body with blood.

Although myocardial infarction can cause cardiac arrhythmia, it is also possible to have cardiac arrhythmia without a myocardial infarction. In fact, <b>it is possible to have a fatal cardiac arrhythmia without a myocardial infarction</b> and this is technically not a heart attack, even though the person dies. This is a rapid and fatal heart problem, but it is technically not a heart attack, so this website will avoid the misleading term <i>heart attack</i>. An arguably better term is {% link 'sudden cardiac death' %}.
