This Is the Page Title

Page type: Special

-----

{% indent %}

This is the first paragraph of contents in the file page_test_01.html.

This is the second paragraph.

{% endindent %}


<h2>This Is a Heading:</h2>

{% indent %}

The heading above should NOT be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags.

\<b>This IS wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags</b> because the &lt;b&gt; was preceded by an escape character (backslash), but the escape character has been stripped.

I will name this paragraph Frank.\

This line is <b><i>still</i></b> part of Frank because I escaped the double-newline, but the escape character has been removed from the output.

Frank is over, this is NOT Frank anymore. Here is a newline character:
The preceding newline character was included inside the paragraph because it was only one character, not two or more.




This paragraph was preceded by like 5 newlines, but only 2 will be visible in the output.

Simple paragraph. Look here: {% this_is_a_test %}

This is a normal paragraph.

<i>This</i> will <b>not</b> be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags because it started with an unescaped &lt;i&gt; tag.

<b>You</b> probably cannot tell that this is supposed to be a new paragraph, but it is not. It starts with an unescaped &lt;b&gt; tag.

This is another normal paragraph.

One more simple paragraph.

Here is the <tt>page_title</tt> Django template variable:
<br />
<b>{{ page_title|safe }}</b>
<br />
That's awesome, see how it is possible to use Django template syntax directly inside this file?

Final paragraph, have a nice day.

<h2>Rigorous Testing of the Lexer and Parser</h2>

{% indent %}

This should be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags and indented.

{% indent %}

This should be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags and indented <b>even more.</b>

{% endindent %}

This should be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags and indented.

<nop>This line starts with &lt;nop&gt; and should NOT have P tags.

<b>You cannot</b> tell that this is a new paragraph in the source file, it lacks P tags. This sentence and the two prior sentences (three sentences total) all look like one paragraph in a browser.

\<b>This</b> will appear as a new paragraph.

The phrase <nop> (NOP) inside a paragraph is NOT taken out by the parser, but it is a meaningless HTML tag so it is invisible in a web browser.

{% endindent %}


<h2>Testing the Custom Template Tags</h2>

{% indent %}

\<b>Simple Tag Examples:</b>
<br />
First example, only one argument: {% wiki 'puffer fish' %}.
<br />
Second example, {% wiki 'lederhosen' 'this has two arguments' %}, the first is the target (the Wikipedia page title) and the second is the displayed text.

Here is a {% old_wiki 'lobster' 'link about lobsters' %} on Wikipedia. The prior link used the <tt>old_wiki</tt> tag.

Did you know that {% wiki 'Pluto (mythology)' 'Pluto' %} is a Greek god but is <i>not</i> a planet? I think that is a terrible dishonor. Also, this paragraph uses the newer <tt>wiki</tt> tag.

The tag name <tt>&#123;&#37; link &#37;&#125;</tt> is <b>not</b> used by Django 1.9, so I will reuse it as a custom template tag.
